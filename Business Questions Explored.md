## Challenges and Solutions
Several challenges were encountered during data import and preparation:
1. **Formatting and Data Type Mismatches**:
   - **Solution:** Used MySQL functions like `STR_TO_DATE()` to handle inconsistent date formats and adjusted data types (e.g., changing `INT` to `BIGINT`) to accommodate large numeric values.
2. **Local File Loading Restrictions**:
   - **Solution:** Enabled the `local_infile` setting and used `secure_file_priv` to allow local file uploads.
3. **Inconsistent Name Formatting**:
   - **Solution:** Applied SQL string functions to split names into first and last names, handling variations like middle initials.
4. **File Access Errors**:
   - **Solution:** Converted CSV files to SQL using an online tool, allowing for direct import into MySQL.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors that drive movie profitability and market success. By understanding the relationships between budget, revenue, genre, and audience preferences, production companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance their strategic planning, resource allocation, and market expansion efforts.
